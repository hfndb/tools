# Imported files and packages

## Files

Some generic files in this program were 'imported' aka copied from another project I created and maintain; [cookware-headless-ice](https://github.com/hfndb/cookware-headless-ice). These files are:
+ src/generic/config.mjs
+ src/generic/log.mjs
+ src/generic/object.mjs
+ src/generic/sys.mjs
+ src/generic/utils.mjs
+ src/generic/store/file-system/dirs.mjs
+ src/generic/store/file-system/files.mjs
+ src/generic/store/file-system/watch.mjs

## Packages

Via these generic files, dependencies came into this project:
+ [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors) for colored console output
+ [date-and-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-and-time) to format and manipulate dates and times
+ [fdir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fdir) to scan directories and files
+ [shelljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs) for Linux-like commands, made portable to Windows
