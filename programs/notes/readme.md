# Notes

**Preview description** of a project which is currently in the phase of active architecturing and developing. By me, since there can only be one for now. Now, while this project is still in progress, some first files were added, though not all yet.

Notes is a [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) program to do something like making notes in order to retrieve those later. Not in a psyche, in memory, but in a computer. Simple, you might think.

However, not using a known [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format) or even some [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) seems a taboo in view of massive infections with the 'having it easy' virus. Within this taboo area, I have used another than customary approach for preserving notes. Which also resulted in other terms, another vocabulary.

Other:
+ 'Save' or 'update' becomes 'retain' as in retaining a note.

Yes, I agree. Only using other terms, words, doesn't make a program really different. In which way this program is really different than others, I for now preserve as a mystery ðŸ˜„
