# Tools

In this repo some notes and tools that I use.

+ bash scripts to git commit, search for text, replace in text etc. If aliases are added in ~/.bashrc:

  - s - Search for a string in files within a certain directory
  - sf - Search on file name within a certain directory
  - r - Replace a string in files within a certain directory
  - gg - Start gvim (or neovim) with provided files open
  - sg - Search for files containing a search string and open them in gvim
  - t - Use ctags-exuberant to generate a tags file in the current directory. If using [cookware-headless-ice](https://github.com/hfndb/cookware-headless-ice), this script doesn't need to be used.

* [vim](./vim/readme.md) with notes about installation, configuration and utility script(s) using the plugins:

  - [YouCompleteMe](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe?categoryPage=3) for [autocompletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete)
  - [emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim/) for Zen coding in HTML and CSS
  - [Gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) for gentle [eye candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_Candy_(Visual_appeal))
  - [yajs.vim](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim) for syntax highlighting in JavaScript, and to enable code folding
  - [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) to get a nice status bar and tab line

It's just a beginning, more will come later.
