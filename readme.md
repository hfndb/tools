# Tools

In this repo some notes and tools that I use.

+ bash scripts to git commit, search for text, replace in text etc. If aliases are added in ~/.bashrc:

  - s - Search for a string in files within a certain directory
  - sf - Search on file name within a certain directory
  - r - Replace a string in files within a certain directory
  - gg - Open gvim (or neovim) with provided files
  - t - Use ctags-exuberant or ctags-universal to generate a tags file in the current directory. If using [cookware-headless-ice](https://github.com/hfndb/cookware-headless-ice), this script doesn't need to be used.

* [notifications](./notifications/readme.md) Tiny application to show system notifications as a modal dialog or popups from the system tray: Birthdays, once a year and 'once a day notifications' like alarm signals or reminders.

* [vim](./vim/readme.md) with notes about installation, configuration and utility script(s)

It's just a beginning, more will come later.
